            <p>A concept album built around a relationship breaking to pieces, and my personal favourite album. It's difficult to describe how perfect this album is combining Lorde's incredible vocals, her imagery, and powerful story telling. It maintains the excellent lyricism and maturity of Pure Heroine while taking a radically different musical direction. The album opens with a banger in Green Light before journeying through a hopeless relationship, before the turning point Hard Feelings / Loveless signifies the second part of the album where Lorde desperately attempts to get over the relationship, finishing with the banger Perfect Places. I would be surprised if any album beats this phenomenal record and the emotional connection I have to it.</p>

            <p>A perfect photo of the pointless angst that human face. The nothingness is dark and this album explores that with depth, with a common theme being the unstoppable movement in time (climaxed in the stellar track of the same name), irony, and the struggle for a purpose.</p> 

            <p>It's refreshing to discover such a cathartic yet painfully honest experience, biting at the truths that we often run away from. It's only sealed into perfection, by Pink Floyd handing us a flowing, vivid adventure - packed with elegant songwriting.</p>

            <p>Kendrick's magnum opus, exploring race, the music industry, and Kendrick's mind in a beautiful fluid journey. Moving a little further away from the accessible nature of 'GKMC', 'TPAB' is an album like no other. The artistic lyricism, the wild jazz production, and the incredible vocals of Lamar at his best create the mix for an album that overwhelming deserves this ranking. It is aided by little details like a poem Kendrick constructs throughout the album, helping the album grow into this piece that you learn a little bit about every time. Yet the journey is joined by these fantastic, unique, stunning songs which stand alone by themselves but when joined together they create a magnum opus that has you emotional from the moment you hear the fade in of Wesley's Theory. It is a masterpiece and sets a legacy that all future hip hop albums will look back on.</p>

            <p>Packing a rich, perfectly produced punch, this is something timelessly enjoyable to listen to. From start to finish, 'my bloody valentine' don't miss the mark and song after song release something cohesively fitting yet different. I love every song here, most of which I consider to be completely perfect - and for the ones that I don't consider them to be as such it's because I find them slightly less enjoyable even though they fit well into the album.</p>

            <p>This comedy special has gorgeous visuals, but after watching it I found myself listening to the soundtrack again, and again, and again. I love every song here, and it's by far my favourite soundtrack that I've listened to so far. 
            <p>With the overarching idea of our vicious consumption of Content established in the opener, Burnham offers an essential description of the world of 2021. He humorously questions whether Comedy is dead and highlights later on how he could be Problematic. He continues on realistic takes about how dismal the world is, most obviously How The World Works, cleverly done through a socket puppet which I see as representing the proleteriat controlled by the bourgeoise (Burnham). The next track, White Woman's Instagram is a bubblegum gem that I cannot stop playing. Burnham then ends the first disc with 30, underlining his relatable fear of ageing and not achieving enough.</p>
            <p>However, in the second disc, Burnham delves deeper into his mental health, as he feels like Shit, a portrait of the horrible mental health of this generation made worse by the COVID era. Throughout both discs he offers cunning meta takes, but perhaps his best piece of songwriting in this record is That Funny Feeling where he combines his understandable dread about the world with consumerist irony about it. It is a well produced song like all of this record, and it reaches into a unique feeling that I can relate to. Burnham ends the record off with a beautifully grandiose closer Goodbye, one of the strongest closers I've ever heard. The final track Any Day Now touches on what Burnham sees as our impending doom, a perfect final track for what this record is.</p> 
            <p>It is extremely rare for me to love every song in a record, for a record to have such clever songwriting, and for a record to have a cohesive journey - but this does all three. Burnham exceeds even further by this whole record having quality production and his meta humour being extremely enjoyable for me. This is near perfect.</p> 
            <p>The only critique I could make is that  this could be more interesting, with the instrumentals feeling a little basic sometimes, so I wonder how well this will age for me over time. </p>
